          I am writing this lying in the top bunk of a 6 bed 'hard bearth' cabin of a sleeper train to Hue. The ceiling of the cabin is 8 inches above my forehead, it is impossible to sit upright.

          We got back from Halong Bay yesterday evening after a great couple of days. I am really glad that we paid a little extra, the tour guide was wonderful and the boat (known as a 'junk') was in good shape. The food was delicious and importantly plentiful. Of course there was an evening of terrible karaoke, but at least we all suffered through it together! The only disappointment was that we couldn't take a day trip to Monkey Island, the seas were too rough according to the captain. To be fair I was happy that they weren't willing to risk our safety just for the sake of sticking to the intinery! Instead we went cycling to a village on Cat Ba island which was hot,  hilly and challenging with a old bike with no gears but fun. Our second night hotel on Cat Ba was one of the nicest hotels we have stayed in with incredible sunset views over the harbour. All in all the tour was run well and worth the money.

          Yesterday was our final day in Hanoi and it was boiling, about 39°C. We spent the day at 2 museums, the war museum and the Ho Chi Mhin museum. Neither were as good as the women's museum but the war museum had some interesting items and lots of war planes and vehicles. The Ho Chi Main museum was odd, there was an exibition chronicling the majority of his life and travels but it cut off in 1947 missing the last 22 years. Upstairs was a huge and confusing art / history exibition which mainly consisted of communist style air / propaganda tributes to him. We rounded the day off with dinner at a different streetside restaurant where we ate delicious noodles and noodle soup while watching the traffic roar and honk by. After collecting our bags from the hotel we walked 20 minutes to the station, the walk was sweaty and required us the survive the crossing of numerous busy roads. There are zebra crossings in Vietnam but I don't think they mean anything, they certainly don't give pedestrians a right of way! We have worked out that the best way to cross is just to go for it when a small gap appears, you have to walk slowly so that the scooters can judge when to dodge round you and just trust that they won't hit you!

          The sleeper train has been pretty shitty compared to the one we took in Thailand. When we boarded a guy in a blue t-shirt (the colour the Vietnamese Railways employees wear) showed us do our cabin and helped us stow our bags in the high alcoves. He was delaying leaving and eventually flashed a bank note at us before we got the message that he wanted a tip. We gave him 20,000 (about 70p) but he said he wanted 100,000 (£3.20), this was ridiculous we gave him 10,000 more which made it £1 and told him to go away. He pulled the same crap on two American girls 3 minutes later and they ended up giving him 80,000 - he kept coming back insisting on more when they gave him 40,000 to start with. He didn't ask the 2 Chinese girls, who were the final addition to our cabin, which made the whole thing even more irritating! On reflection I don't think he even worked for the railway. ( km. From From From We We We From I had longsome reviews warning against thieves on these trains and when we turned off the light to sleep I was a bit jumpy  about our bags which were at  the end of our bunks. I was drifting off when I heard the door slide open, I lurched up without my glasses on and saw the blurry outline of guy in our room. His hand was reaching for the bottom of my bunk, I smacked at his arm and shouted "HEY!", he replied "Ow, wtf?!" and I realised after getting my glasses on that it was just Charlie. As he clambered back up to his bunk we both got a fit of the giggles and had to jam our hands over our mouth so that we didnt wake up or cabinmates. All in all not a particularly restful night!
