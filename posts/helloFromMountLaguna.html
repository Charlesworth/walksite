		  I write this sitting in a log cabin with a bag of ice pressed against my left foot. I don't think it is a serious problem but when I got up this morning it was painful to walk. I rolled my foot on a rock on Monday while climbing a hill at about mile 30. The next stretch is 30 miles of wilderness and I didn't want to be caught out while in the middle!
          <br>
		  <br>
		  Since we flew out last Thursday Charlie and I have been very busy, we spent the first couple of days firstly getting from LA to San Diego (a beautiful city) and shopping for the last couple of pieces of kit we needed and also goods for our first five days on the trail. Trail Angel Rob Reiss picked us up Saturday afternoon and we stayed at his house that night. There were 5 of us starting on the 10th: Charlie and I, Ramone, Savanna and Paul Lockey.
          <br>
		  <br>
		  When we woke it was raining,  Bob described it as "weeping fog", which I thought was a great phase. Bob drove us out to Campo for 6:20 (check out the photos page for pictures) and Charlie and I got on to the trail at around 6.45. We had said to ourselves that we were not going to do the whole 20 mile waterless stretch to Lake Morena, our plan was to pace ourselves, taking into account our fitness and the weight we were carrying, which unbelievably ended up as 40 pounds each! Despite this we totally ignored our plan and ended up going the distance to the lake. The morning and early afternoon were awesome, we hiked with Savanna then Ramone and finally a guy called Kevin. Ramone and Kevin were quick compared to us and it felt like they were level boosting us. At mile 15, Hauser Creek, we should have stopped, but stupidly we decided to press on up a huge hill climb which gained 1500 feet of elevation over 2 miles. The last 5 miles were horrible but we finally hobbled into the camp ground at 5.30pm.
          <br>
		  <br>
		  On Monday we re-evaluated and set a target of 12 miles. Again the morning and few early afternoon was great, we hiked with a few new people and the views were brilliant. I hit a bit of a wall after hurting my ankle, but with Charlie's encouragement and half a KitKat Chunky we made it to a tent-site at mile 32. The site was set in a small grove of trees and was lovely, though to be honest I didn't spend much time appreciating it as I collapsed into our tent as soon as it was up. There was a storm that night but out tent held up just fine.
          <br>
		  <br>
		  Tuesday we planned a 10 mile day which would take us to Mount Laguna. The day was pretty good; almost the whole day we were climbing but for the most part it was a gradual climb. Charlie's little toe has been taken hostage by a blister that is almost it's equal and by the end of the day both he and I were on Struggle Street with our feet. This was slightly alleviated by our decision to listen to some music while walking and the gorgeous woods we hiked through during the final mile. We reached the Mount Laguna cafe at 3.15 pm, unfortunately it had closed at 3. A little deflated (we were planning to have our first hot meal in 3 days there) we headed to the outfitters to buy Charlie some trekking poles, he had been deeply regretting his decision to try going without. The gear shop was an Aladdin's cave and the people working there were more than happy to sell you something to reduce pack weight. Fearing for our wallets we avoided a pack 'shake down'. We moved on to the post office which typically had closed 15 minutes before and ran into a few of the guys we had hiked with. The camp site we thought was in Mount Laguna was actually 2 miles up the road and there was nothing we could do but carry on walking.
          <br>
		  <br>
		  It's now Wednesday, we have spent the day hanging out in the tiny mountain village of Mount Laguna. It's beautiful here. A guy called Ed who manages the Mount Laguna campsite very kindly gave us a ride to the general store / lodge reception and we have spent the majority of the day cluttering up the store's porch and chatting to the owner, John and any other hikers who rolled in.  We booked a room for the night and finally got to eat at the cafe.  I hope that the ice on my foot and the time off should allow us to leave tomorrow and start toward the town of Julian were we here there is free pie and a beer for hikers.
