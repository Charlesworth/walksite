          We left the lights of Vegas on Friday morning to start our 4 and half hour drive to the Grand Canyon in Arizona. The start of the journey was across vast desert plains and we watched the storm clouds roll of the mountains ahead, occasionally a cloud would break over us and pelt the car with rain and hail. The drive took most of the day and we arrived at the GC state Park at around 4pm, we secured the second to last spot in Mather Campground.

          <br>
          We got our tent set up with practiced ease and headed back out in the car to explore. We stumbled upon the South Rim view point just before sunset and stayed there to watch the sun dip beneath the horizon. The setting sun cast a magical orange light on the already red rocks of the canyon. As soon as the sun dissappeared the heavy clouds that had been racing towards us from the West reached the canyon and we made a run for the car. The rain was shortlived but once darkness fell we holded up in the comfy rental car and watched a film on my phone. We headed to bed / mat at about 11 and slept OK, though Charlie woke me in the night asking if I could here a noise outside. It was a strange sound and after about 10 minutes of straining to listen for an animal we realised that it was just the sound of snow hitting and sliding down our tent!

          We caught the shuttle bus to the south rim Kaibab Trailhead in the morning. We planned a simple 6 mile hike, 3 miles down and 3 up and with our almost empty backpacks we were looking forward to it. It was still showing as we got to the trail and looking down to the canyon we could only see fog / clouds. As we made our way down the fog started to dissipate and by the time we were 1.5 miles down we could see across to the other side. We spent time taking lots of photos and eventually got to Skeleton Point (3 miles) at lunchtime, we stopped and ate a hikers lunch of granola, salt and vinegar chrisps and beef jerky. The hike back up was unsurprisingly steep and made harder by the giant steps that had been cut into the trail. We felt pretty good doing it though and passed a few people on the way up, those PCT miles paying off!
          <br>
          <br>
          After a shower in the campground (2 dollars for 8 minutes was a decadent bargain!) we set off on the road again. We had to head back to Big Bear Lake which was 7 hours drive away to pick up a package from the post office and wanted to get as far as possible that afternoon / evening.
