          One of the main reasons for selling my possessions, quitting my job and going on a five and a half month hike was to get away from the more mundane things in my life: work emails, taking the bins out, bills, boring nights in, etc. One thing that I will be taking away with me is my love of programming, its challenging, enjoyable and also how I make money!
          <br>
          <br>

          Fair warning: this post will be boring if you’re not interested in computers. I’m going to try and have my cake and eat it, by having an ultralight pack while also lugging around a computer to program with on the trail. I’ll be carrying a Microsoft Surface 3 tablet during the walk:
        </p>
        <br>
          <ul>
            <li>It’s only weighs 600g.</li>
            <li>It’s Micro USB chargeable.</li>
            <li>Contains a x86 processor, so can use my preferred development tools.</li>
            <li>Has a reasonable battery life, about 10 hours of text editing.</li>
            <li>Costs only £340 ($480).</li>
          </ul>

          <br>
          <p style="font-weight: bold;" align="left">

          While I would prefer a Linux environment, this does afford me the additional opportunity to learn about Windows PowerShell. It also looks like Windows 10 will be getting full Bash interoperability the summer. There isn’t a laptop near the to the same low weight; anything close is at least 2x to 3x times the price.  Its also means I can watch a film in the comfort of my tent or play a few turns of touch optimized civ5.
          <br>
          <br>

          To go with the Surface, I have an 82g fold-able Bluetooth keyboard. It’s certainly not the greatest typing experience but is lightweight and far better than the Windows on screen keyboard.
          <br>
          <br>

          To sate my power requirements I am also bringing a 10,000 milliampere battery pack and micro USB charging solar panel. All of the gadgetry I am bringing is micro USB chargeable: my headlamp, phone, surface tablet, and the spare battery pack will all leech from the ample Californian sun. I’m hoping the battery pack won’t see much use until Oregon and further north.
          <br>
          <br>

          I’ll be hoping to keep up to date on my C++ and Go skills during my time away, while mainly learning a new language, Rust. I’m hoping to make a game using Rust to test out its viability as a C++ successor. You can keep up to date with my work via <a href="https://github.com/charlesworth">my Github profile</a> and if I do finish the game I’ll make sure to distribute it for you all to try. At the same time I’ll be updating this website with content and a few new features. I’ll be writing about this website in a future post, hopefully offering some detail into the zero cost (not including domain purchase) web hosting used here and a bit about the dynamic content hosted on my private server. Thanks for reading.

          Both Charlie and I were panicking that we wouldn't be able to get everything done in time to give the property back to the landlord by Wednesday, all of us were on edge and more than once a couple of harsh words were exchanged by all. Our mood wasn't improved when Debbie accidentally reversed the van into the corner of the front porch. Charlie was loudly warning her not to run over the small bush in the front drive when we heard a sad little crunching sound. We all jumped out and looked in horror at the small dent above the rear doors. I wish she had flattened the bloody bush! It's not even a nice bush. Of course in our usual cheapskate way we had decided against paying the extra £16 a day to reduce the damage excess to £250 so we were on the hook for up to £1,200 plus all the nasty extras worked into the hire agreement. That's like a whole month of saving for both of us / the extra month in Asia we were planning post PCT. We were not happy! By 9 pm we had dragged ourselves out of our dark mood and had finished packing the van. Both of us cheered when we posted the front door key through the letterbox.

          The next day we unloaded the van at Debbie's house, she is very kindly storing our stuff while we are away. Charlie and I had decided the night before that we were going to be ruthless with our possessions and by the end of the morning we had a large stack designated for the charity shop. Lots of it was pieces of furniture I had accumulated over the years, none of it expensive but I had spent time fixing it up and was attached to it. I realised that I have the rest of my life to accumulate nicer furniture and that jettisoning it now would literally lift a weight from our minds. It was actually very refreshing to get rid of it - like ripping a plaster off. The rest of our stuff that we did decide to keep - primarily Charlie's computer stuff and my books, is now safely stowed in the loft. I am looking forward to just having a backpack for the next 6+ months.

          With dread and fear for our finances we took the van back to the hire company, we had decided not to mention the Porch Incident and were keeping our fingers and toes crossed that they did not notice the dent in their almost brand new van. After 2-3 tense minutes waiting at the desk the lady came back in and said everything was in order. We thanked her and swiftly left, all hiding smiles of triumph. I hope that this means that we are now off the hook as they accepted the van back after checking it over but we have agreed not to think of ourselves as out of the woods yet, just in case they call me.

          This time next week we will be on the bus to the airport, between now and then most of our time will be spent seeing friends and family and getting the last few things we need gear-wise. I have a gear list in progress and intend to do a gear post before we go (if there is time!) Today is the day that I have to cancel all our bills so I will spend most of it on the phone, but yay - no bills for 6 months!
