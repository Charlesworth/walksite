          We have just spent a week in the small town of Santa Rosa where we were house sitting for a lady named Lisa. We looked after her 2 English cocker spaniels and her cat. It was a pretty easy gig with our primary responsibility being feeding and walking the dogs. The town was real Americana, pretty houses with  porches lining wide streets, basketball hoops in the drive of every third house. It wasn't the most exciting place but it gave us time to relax and plan our next move.
          <br>
          <br>
          Charlie and I were divided about what to do next, I wanted to give the trail another go -  specifically the Sierras but Charlie wasn't sure about it. He graciously agreed to give it another go for my sake and we started making plans. Every day we checked the weather reports and the various social media sites for the PCT searching for news of what snow would be waiting for us in the mountains. The news wasn't good, most people seemed to be waiting out the snow at Kennedy Meadows.  We ummed and arrred and backed and fourth for a couple of days until I decided finally on the second to last day of our stay that I didn't want to die in the snow.
          <br>
          <br>
          So where would we go next? The plan had always been to visit Asia once we were done with the walk, we looked at flights to Thailand and within 12 hours of our decision we had booked to fly from San Francisco to Bankok. It felt a little quick but to be honest we were fed up with the US and Asia is way way cheaper!
          <br>
          <br>
          We flew out of San Francisco Airport at 1.40 am Saturday morning, the first leg was a 12 hour flight to Taipei (Taiwan) with a 2 hour lay over and then the second was a 4 hour flight to Bangkok. We flew with China Airlines and to be honest the hours passed pretty quickly, I watched 4 films in total which helped pass the time.
          <br>
          <br>
          We got through immigration without a hitch despite our worries that they would need to see a departing ticket and booked and uber to take us to the hostel. The uber cost 325 Thai Bhat which is about Â£6.50 for a 30 min drive. We are staying at the Lub B Silom and after checking in at 11am we decided to have a sleep for an hour. 1 hour accidentally turned into 6 hours and it was 7pm by the time we got back onto the streets... whoops!
          <br>
          <br>
          We went in search of a street market, on leaving the hostel it started chucking it down but the rain was warm so we carried on. Eventually we stumbled across an all you can eat restaurant which allowed diners to cook the food themselves on a metal hot plate over a pot of coals on their table (see photos) . There was a huge selection of ingredients, most of which we didn't recognise but we went going to let that stop us! We jokingly said that if we were going to get food poisoning then we would only have ourselves to blame, we probably overcooked everything in an attempt to avoid this! After filling up on food we could only recognise half of the time we headed back and crashed for even more sleep.
