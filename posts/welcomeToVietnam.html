          We are now in Vietnam, we flew in from Laos on Tuesday evening and were lucky to see the sunset above the clouds, which is one of my favourite things. We landed in the brand new airport in the sprawling city of Hanoi and after withdrawing 4 million Vietnamese Dong from the atm and indulging in a visit to the airport Burger King we caught a bus into the city centre. We have been staying in a hostel in the old quarter of the city amid the usual crazy scooter traffic, terrifyingly tangled electric and telephone cables and local markets and restaurants. The locals seem to spend the majority of their days on the streets. Unlike Bangkok and it's food carts, here the best food can be found at the clusters of low tables and tiny plastic stools that spring up randomly on the pavements like clusters of brightly coloured mushrooms. These seem to be family run and usually consist of a couple of bubbling pots of noodle soup and some deep fried meat. Yesterday we tried one of them for breakfast, after squeezing our knees beneath the low table, or in Charlie's case sitting with his kneecaps around his ears the owner asked simply "beef or chicken". At 30,000 VD (£1) a bowl this alfresco dining is not to be passed up! We gobbled down our noodles serenaded by the traffic horns and the chatter of local taxi drivers who were loitering a metre from us. I also have to mention the bread, like Laos the bread is incredible, French style baguettes are everywhere from the tiny old lady sitting on the busy street corner to the more upmarket restaurants bread lovers like me can indulge.

          You can definitely feel and see the remanents of the colonial French rule here, Hanoi feels a bit like and Asian version of Paris with its wide bricked pavements and tall elegant buildings with pillars and wrought iron balconies. Although unsurprisingly buildings and standards are slightly shabbier here, especially in the old quarter and much more haphazard. Yesterday we saw some men from a telephone company putting up two bamboo ladders in the middle of a busy road  leaning against the overhanging telephone cables and the  the two smallest / youngest members of the team ascending them to carry out repairs while traffic weaved between the feet of the ladders.

          We spent the day yesterday organising a tour for the next 3 days and wandering around a couple of museums. We walked to the Women's Museum and spent an hour and a half leading about the different roles that Vietnamese women play from traditional wife and mother to street vendor and former members of the resistance. The museum was well set out with informative displays in Vietnamese, French and English. Well worth a visit and the £1 entry fee. We also visited Hanoi's former prison built by the French to imprison political prisoners. Unsurprisingly the presentation was very one sided but nevertheless the buildings and displays were interesting.

          Today we are off to Halong Bay, the bay of the descending dragon which you my have seen pictures of it any Vietnam tourism brochure -  lots of small islands in a sparkling sea. I have been writing this post while on the bus out from Hanoi and it is decidedly clouded today, but I am holding on to the hope that it will be sunny at the end of the 3 hour drive! We will be spending tonight on the tour boat and tomorrow on Cat Ba island. We have read quite a few horror stories about this type of trip but having paid the midrange rather than budget price we are hoping that our tour company will be good! I will report back in a few days!
