          Tomorrow we leave beautiful Chiang Mai, we have been here since Saturday the 2nd. Despite being one of the most visited cities in Thailand Chiang Mai has a very different vibe to Bankok and Phuket, everything seems alot closer together and chilled out. Also there is  huge coffee / cafe culture here which has adds to the laid back feel. We spent pretty much all of our time within the tumbled down walls of the old city which form an exact square ringed by a moat interdispersed with fountains. You can walk from one side of the square to the other in around 30 mins, or an hour if you get distracted by one or two of the many wats (Bhudist temples) that are dotted on what seems to be every other street. Northern Thailand is much more mountainous than the South and with Chiang Mai situated in a valley at the foot of two mountains it is much cooler (i.e 29 °C not 35°C).
          <br>
          <br>
          We have matched our activities here to the vibe of the city and have been very chilled out. On Sunday we spent the evening meandering through the biggest Street market I have ever been to. They shut down a road that stretches from a Wat at the centre of the city square all the way to the edge and thousand of people walk up and down the stalls which seem to sell anything and everything. There are numerous food sections,  which is the main reason we were there, and I ate the best bbq'ed pork ribs I have ever had while sitting on a plastic stool on the side of the road. That evening we also stumbled upon a really legit jazz bar, apparently Chiang Mai attracts alot of Thailand's artists and musicians.
          <br>
          <br>
          Over the last few days we have visited various wats as we wandered passed them and drank hot and iced coffee (sometimes orders are lost in translation and it's best just to go with it!) at numerous coffee houses. We spent Sunday hunting down a proper English roast dinner and found it at expat run restaurant, Archer's. It was amazing, I realise that it's the direct opposite of local cuisine, however after being away for 3 months we were craving a taste of home! Talking of food Northern Thailand has its own specialities,  the main one being curried chicken noodle soup. We tried this in the dingy basement food court of the Chinatown mega market and it was incredible, I had a second bowl just to check!
          <br>
          <br>
          Another highlight for us was going to the random but very highly reviewed Insect Museum. Owned, curated and accumulated by an elderly Thai couple the museum is operated out of their house, you have to ring the doorbell for them to let you in. It was a little pricey at 200thb (£4) each but given that the owner was sat in the lobby I felt confident that it was going to the right people. The owners specialised in mosquitoes during their very impressive scientific careers and the museum is crammed with mosquito specimens and info. Charlie and I felt that we had to go if only just to keep going ourtradition of visiting weird museums when we are abroad. There were lots of other oddities there as well including a collection of teak carvings, a samurai sword and precious stones along with loads of perfectly preserved insect specimens.

          Tomorrow we catch a bus to Laos!
