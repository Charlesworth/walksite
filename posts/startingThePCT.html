		<h2>Blog Tardiness</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;" align="left">
		  Updating this blog has been a bit tough as we have sent the computer and keyboard forward to mile ~180. It was a bit too much weight (even at only 600g) as we struggle through the first few weeks. At the moment I am editing the website on my mobile phone and using the android terminal to publish our content, it's surprising how much you can get done with only a smartphone even if it is a bit unwieldy. Also, unsurprisingly, Internet access is sporadic in the middle if the Californian desert.

		<h2>Meeting Hikers</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;" align="left">
		  One of the main reasons for leaving was I felt I had become extremely cynical, which I believe is a common side effect of working in a large corporation. 
		  <br>
		  <br>
		  Meeting people on the trail has been great relief, I've made an effort to chat with everyone I see on the trail. We've already met some weird and wonderful people. For example; sitting in a bar yesterday I was chatting to a chap who was one day away from cycling across the US, from Florida to LA. He told me about a homeless man who believed he could raise the dead, a multimillionaire miser who lived in a dirty old trailer and how the kindness of strangers had been a reliable fixture throughout his trip.
		  <br>
		  <br>
		  Everyone is up for a laugh and it's rare we'll camp alone.

		<h2>Hiker Demographics</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;" align="left">
		  I have found most, if not all, of the hikers to be well educated and polite. So far hikers seem to be mostly white middle class.
          <br>
	      <br>
		  I've only met one Donald Trump supporter, and have found our fellow hikers to be about 70/30 Democrat to Republican. Most find it amusing that I gamble on US politics and have lost money on Trump’s continued popularity. There appears to be a general malaise towards Hillary Clinton. 
		  <br>
	      <br>
		  Around 80% of the Americans we meet ask if we're Australian, most probably due to the fact we don't have the posh or cockney accents the movie bad guys have. This is exclusively an American trait, other nationalities recognize our Britishness without issue.
		  <br>
	      <br>
		  Somewhat surprisingly to me, the majority of hikers I've met are non-religious.
		  <br>
	      <br>
		  Most people are hiking solo, with a few couples or preexisting friend groups dotted around. We have met one English family; a mother, father, 10 year old son and 12 year old daughter making the through hike which I think is fantastic. </p>

		<h2>Cleanliness and Smelly-ness</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;" align="left">
		  Having done a technical degree and spending time in the computer labs, I am somewhat accustomed to people with a ripe smell about them. This has been better than I assumed on the trail. Most people have one set of hiking clothes to keep weight down, so you will end up wearing the same clothes day to day. I guess people's own “scent” perhaps deadens that of others; there hasn't been an occurrence of me thinking “wow, that guy really stinks”. Let's see what longer stretches with hotter weather brings.</p>

		<h2>Trail Happiness</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;" align="left">
		  I recently went to a orthopedic surgeon as I had a small lump on the bridge of my foot and wanted to get it checked before the walk (don't worry, it's fine). When explaining about the trip the doctor commented that “you cannot bank happiness”, and it really resounded with me. After seeing a 2 rounds of redundancies and the unfortunate passing away of a colleague, work has taken a new position lower down the list of life priorities. This year I hope to concentrate more on contentment, whether on or off the PCT. </p>
