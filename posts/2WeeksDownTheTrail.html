          Charlie and I have now been on the trail for two weeks, I have already got to the the point where I can't keep track of what day of the week it is. We have walked 141 miles and are now inÂ  the mountain town of Idyllwild which is near PCT mile 177. Some parts of the PCT are currently closed due to forest fires so we hitched about 12 miles to get here, there was an alternative route that involved lots of road walking, but to be honest we wanted to get into town! Hats off to the people that did hike the alternate though. We were meant to hike out today up into the mountains but the weather forecast snow / hail / rain and high winds. Jodie and Ashley who we split a cabin with last night suggested staying here annother night and we jumped at the chance. I am glad we did because it has just started snowing / hailing! 
          <br>
          <br>
		  
		  Since we left Julian last Monday we have been through some tough stretches, the first 32 miles from mile 77 to Warner Springs at 109 and the second 32 miles from 109 to Paradise Valley Cafe at 141. The Californian dessert heat has really picked up over the past week and we have been struggling to walk through the hottest part of the day. The trail turns into an oven at 11.30 and cooks until about 4.30. To combat this we have been getting up early and starting walking at 6am and then if possible finding a scraggy dessert bush to hide under for a few hours at midday. The days where we have walked through we have been very slow and one of us usually ends up getting quite down or frustrated with the heat. I expected the first few weeks to be hard but to be honest it's the mental side of things which we are finding the hardest. Physically we are improving and getting our "hiker legs", we are averaging about 15 miles a day despite the time we spend avoiding the sun. Lots of people are quicker than us but we are slowly improving. The boredom is the main issue, I am finding that if I am not distracted in the afternoons by music or an audio book then all I can think about is how much my feet hurt or how sweaty I am. I hope the heat doesn't break us.

		  Getting away from the negative here are a few things I have loved so far (in no particular order):
		  <br>
          <br>
		  
		  1. There are Rosemary bushes all along the trail which makes the place smell amazing! 
          <br>
          <br>
		  
		  2. The sand and occasional streams have lots of sparkling bits which we think may be gold (as we are in gold rush country) or possibly pyrite which means that my calves are constantly glittering when I am covered in dust. 
          <br>
          <br>
		  
		  3. The views are jaw dropping (though I spend most of the day focusing on the ground 2 feet in front of me so I don't trip over the small rocks that cover the trail).
          <br>
          <br>
		  
		  4. Pretty much everyone we have met have been amazing, the other hikers and all the people who live in the towns along the way. When we came down from the hills at mile 141 and there was a guy called 12% who is hiking this year and who has completed the PCT before was there handing out in-and-out burgers and ice cold cokes. Trail magic is awesome. 
          <br>
          <br>
		  
		  On Saturday night we spent the evening with some US veterans who are hiking the PCT supported  by a group called Warrior Hikes. We camped with them before before Scissors Crossing and  bumped into them again when we arrived at Idyllwild, whenever they get off trail they are picked up by the local veterans association / American Legion post and put up and fed and generally appreciated. They invited us for bratwurst and beer at the Idyllwild American Legion post 800. We were a bit anxious that we would be crashing but when we got there we were made so welcome and there was Kareoke! They were taking photos and included us (check out the American Legion post 800 Facebook page if you are interested).
