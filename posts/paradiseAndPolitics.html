          Our time in the East islands has come to an end and we are now in the northen city of Chang Mai. It has taken us over two days to get here via minibus, ferry, night bus, sleeper train and finally tuttut. Needless to say we are tired and in desperate need of showers! We are waiting for our hotel room to be ready at the moment.

          Since my last post we have become SSI qualified open water scuba divers certified to dive to up to 18m below. After chilling for a couple of days in Koh Samui we met the guys at the tiddly island airport and caught a ferry to the even smaller island of Koh Tao (Turtle Island). We had booked our scuba course with Big Blue Diving School who are located directly on the beach to the west of the tiny island. For less than Â£200 including accommodation they taught us to dive. It was amazing, despite the poor visibility cause by a storm earlier in the month, by the final dive we felt comfortable under the waves and had seen hundreds of fish. No turtles unfortunately but that just gives us an excuse to go back! Koh Tao was beautiful and the weather was great which was a relief after the rainy weeks in Phuket and especially as Dodge and Elliott had flown out with thoughts of blue sky's and white beaches!

          I am going to pause from recounting our travels to acknowledge a monumental event that took place on the 23rd of June. We at a beach bar when we saw the news, we were all astounded when the Brexit referendum results revealed that 52% of the British public voted to leave the European Union. I couldn't believe it, neither Charlie or I had thought that leave would ever win. My feelings are a mixture of horror, shame, anger and sadness for my generation and those who follow us. My anger is at those people who voted leave as some sort of anti government protest vote or though who did not bother to look at and think about the implications. I am embarrassed that the British public could be duped by the racist and frankly plain stupid policies of the Leave campaign. Many voted to "reclaim thier borders" without realising that that preventing the movement of EU citizens had never been the Leave campaign's intentions! Its over a week later and I am still on the verge of tears as I write this, checking the news has become torture as we watch the British economy flounder and the political circus playing pass the buck. I am terrified that I won't  be able to get a job when we get back to the UK due to what seems to be the inevitable downtown of the property market and don't know whether to rush home now  and try to get a job before the crash really hits. This of course is all made worse by the uncertainty of whether we will actually leave or not (obviously I do not want us to). It seems like many people are  now full of "Bregret" and would, given the chance of a do-over, vote to remain. Neither Charlie or I truly believe that we will leave, it seems like utter madness to me that we would continue and trigger Article 50 at this point when the key Leave campaigners are breaking the integral parts of their manifesto (i.e. their pledge of millions for the NHS). If they are unable to deliver what they promised and the public are having second thoughts then why leave? In recent history other EU states have held referendums on the question to leave or stay and despite their citizens voting leave they have remained,  e.g. France. At this point I am reduced to hoping for a snap election and for the Liberal Democrats to run on the platform that their elected MPs will not vote to leave. I can't imagine a future where I am not an EU citizen and I am scared.

          That was a longer pause from the happy than I intended but I needed to write it. I dont feel in the mood to talk about our plans for the next few days, everything seems overshadowed by the turmoil at home.
